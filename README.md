# vcore3-ratos-config

This is my personal Klipper config for my 400mm Rat Rig V-Core 3.

Current config:

* LGX extruder
* V6 hot end
* BTT Octopus v1.1
* Euclid probe

I'm using *parts of* the modular Klipper config in [RatOS](https://os.ratrig.com), and the `config` submodule points to that repository.  I've chosen not to include `config/macros.cfg` in preference to my own, for more control and readability.
